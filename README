This plugin works to spawn mobs above Mob Spawners. It spawns mobs based on what block the spawner is set on.
For instance, block 89 (GlowStone), is the trigger for spiders. This is all set in the config.properties file. 
The spawning occurs when there is a redstone change underneath the trigger block.  

**IMPORTANT**
The config.properties and data.txt files located on the github repo DO NOT DO ANYTHING. 
They should be located in the plugins/Redstone Spawning folder that the plugin creates.
These files are here as an example.
